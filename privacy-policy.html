            <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT</h2>

            <p>Here's a description of the categories of information we may collect when you interact with our Service, and examples of how we use the specific types of information.</p>

            <h3>Information You Provide Us</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account data,</strong> such as your email address and password (required to create an account on our Service) and other information you may choose to provide, such as your first name, last name, phone number, and gender. If you create an account or log into the App using third-party services, such as Google or Facebook, we will receive information about you as permitted by your profile settings on the third-party service in order to authenticate you. The information we receive when you authenticate through a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in the relevant third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Information uploaded by you on the App</strong>, such as your emotional state surveys, therapy session responses, and recovery progress data.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications</strong> that we exchange with users when they contact us and use our support services. We also collect your information when you wish to set an e-meeting with us, to share with us your ideas about new features you would like to see on Detache or when providing us with your feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment and transactional data</strong> if you choose to sign up for a premium account with additional features and content, including name, payment card information, bank account number, billing information, and your transaction history. This information is collected by Apple (and if applicable, Google) with respect to in-app purchases made through the App. If you make a purchase for the App through our Site, our payment processor, Stripe, Inc., will collect and process your payment information. In addition to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, information related to your payments or purchases is also processed according to Stripe's services agreement and privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Information We Receive From Your Use of the Service</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photo and media data</strong>, collected when you choose to use our digital detox features to remove triggering content from your device. This data is processed locally on your device and is needed to identify and remove photos, videos, and other content related to your past relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Therapy and recovery data</strong>, if you choose to engage with our AI therapy features and authorize the App to store this data. Each session, Detache analyzes your responses and progress to provide personalized insights and recommendations for your healing journey. Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, (a) we use therapy and recovery data only to provide the Service and not for advertising, and (b) we will not disclose this data for advertising, marketing, or use-based data mining not needed to provide the Service.</li>

            <h2>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>

            <p>We use cookies, pixel tags, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Service and use that information to send targeted advertisements.</p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>

            <p>Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in your device memory. We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). To the extent we provide a cross-platform experience, we may also correlate information from cookies used on our website with actions taken in our App.</p>

            <p>On the Service, we use the following types of cookies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for our Sites to function and cannot be switched off. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our Sites.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalization Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our Sites to remember choices you make and provide enhanced, more personal features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Pixel tags</h3>

            <p>Pixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels), are small pieces of code that can be embedded on websites and emails. Pixel tags may be used to learn how you interact with our website pages and emails, and this information helps us, and our partners provide you with a more tailored experience.</p>

            <h3>Third-party analytics services</h3>

            <p>We use third-party analytics services to help analyze how users use the Service. These services use cookies, scripts and other tracking technologies to collect and analyze information such as how often users visit the Service, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Service.</p>

            <h3>Online tracking opt out</h3>

            <p>There are a number of ways to limit online tracking, which we have summarized below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blocking cookies in your browser.</strong> Most browsers let you remove or reject cookies, including cookies used for interest-based advertising. To do this, follow the instructions in your browser settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Blocking advertising ID use in your mobile settings.</strong> Your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for interest-based advertising purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Using privacy plug-ins or browsers.</strong> You can block our websites from setting cookies used for interest-based ads by using a browser with privacy features, like Brave, or installing browser plugins like Privacy Badger, Ghostery, or uBlock Origin, and configuring them to block third party cookies/trackers.</li>
                <li><strong>Platform opt outs.</strong> The following advertising partners offer opt out features that let you opt out of use of your information for interest-based advertising.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please note that because these opt out mechanisms are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on every browser and device that you use.</p>

            <h2>DATA RETENTION</h2>

            <p>We keep your personal information for as long as you have a Detache account. To protect the safety and security of our users, your personal information will be retained for a reasonable period of time following account deletion. To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

            <h2>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>

We encourage you to review and understand the privacy practices of any Third Party Sites before providing any information to or through such Third Party Sites.</p>

            <h2>SECURITY</h2>

            <p>You use the Service at your own risk. We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect personal information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via the Service or e-mail.

            <p>The CCPA grants California residents the following rights:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information.</strong> This Privacy Policy describes how we use and share your personal information through the Service, including during the past 12 months. The Policy describes:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The sources through which we collect California residents' personal information and the types of personal information collected in the "Personal Information We May Collect" section above.</li>

For example, companies may not provide users in response to access requests certain sensitive information and other consumers' personal information, and may exclude information that would compromise the confidentiality of trade secrets. The CCPA also places limits on when companies must comply with a deletion request.</p>

            <p>You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.</p>

            <p>Here is how you can submit requests:</p>
