            <h2>Purchases</h2>

            <h3>Fees</h3>

            <p>Detache offers certain enhanced features of the Services which you can purchase as a monthly or yearly subscription ("Subscription"). A description of features associated with Subscriptions is available via the Services. When you purchase a Subscription or a Product (each, a "Transaction"), we may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, such as your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your address(es) for billing and delivery (such information, "Payment Information"). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information.</p>

            <p>The amounts due and payable by you for a Transaction through the Services will be presented to you before you place your order. If you choose to initiate a Transaction via the Services, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third party service providers so we can complete your Transaction and agree (a) to pay the applicable fees and any taxes; (b) that Detache may charge your credit card or third party payment processing account, including, but not limited to, your account with the app store or distribution platform (like the Apple App Store, Google Play or the Amazon Appstore) where the App is made available (each, an "App Provider"), for verification, pre-authorization and payment purposes; and (c) to bear any additional charges that your App Provider, bank or other financial service provider may levy on you as well as any taxes or fees that may apply to your order.</p>

            <p>You'll receive a confirmation email after we confirm the payment for your order. Your order is not binding on Detache until accepted and confirmed by Detache. All payments made are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in these Terms.</p>

            <p>If you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, you agree to raise them with us first and you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or third party payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with Detache.</p>

            <p>Detache reserves the right to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances, for example, if your credit card is declined, if we suspect the request or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Detache deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Detache also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity in connection with your order. You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). Detache will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.</p>

            <h3>Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel & How to Cancel Your Subscription</h3>

            <p>All amounts are payable and charged: For monthly or yearly subscriptions, at the beginning of the subscription and, because each such subscription renews automatically for an additional period equal in length to the expiring subscription term until you cancel it, at the time of each renewal until you cancel, using the Payment Information you have provided. You must cancel your monthly or yearly Subscription before it renews to avoid the billing of the fees for the next Subscription period. If you purchase your Subscription via the Site, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription at any time by contacting us by email at support@detache.app. If you purchase your Subscription via an App Provider, you can cancel the renewal of your subscription at any time with the App Provider. You will not receive a refund for the fees you already paid for your current subscription period and you will continue to receive the Services ordered until the end of your current Subscription period.</p>

            <h3>Changes to Price Terms for Subscriptions</h3>

            <p>Detache reserves the right to change its pricing terms for Subscriptions at any time and Detache will notify you in advance of such changes becoming effective. Changes to the pricing terms will not apply retroactively and will only apply for Subscription renewals after such changed pricing terms have been communicated to you. If you do not agree with the changes to Detache's pricing terms then you may choose not to renew your Subscription in accordance with the section "Subscriptions Automatically Renew Until You Cancel & How to Cancel Your Subscription."</p>

            <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

            <h3>Generally</h3>

            <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Detache in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Detache agree that any and every dispute arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DETACHE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

            <h3>Exceptions</h3>

            <p>Notwithstanding the above, this Dispute Resolution section shall not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Detache may bring in any court with competent jurisdiction: (i) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use of the Services, infringement or violation of Detache's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. For any such excepted claim or dispute, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p>

            <h3>Arbitration Agreement</h3>

            <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>

            <h2>General Terms</h2>

            <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Detache and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Detache and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Detache's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Detache may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

            <p>Any notices or other communications provided by Detache under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by Detache via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

            <p>Detache's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Detache. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
